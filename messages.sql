It\'s been nearly a 23 year-long love. There\'s been the good: three Super Bowl victories; the bad: three consecutive 5-11 seasons; and you\'d better believe there\'s been the ugly: Chad Hutchinson. Most of you probably know that I was very much for the removal/retirement/whatever of Bill Parcells. Moreover, I\'m quite fond of the hiring of Wade Phillips.\r\n\r\nFor all of the Tuna\'s egotistical and stubborn acts, he managed to assemble an extremely talented football team -- which is one of the chief reasons I felt he should\'ve been fired. Even before we thought Tony Romo had any chance of being good, Drew \"Fumble Waiting to Happen\" Bledsoe was more than enough to take a team with Terrell Owens, Terry Glenn, Julius Jones, Jason Witten, Roy Williams, Terrence Newman, Greg Ellis, and Demarcus Ware to the Super Bowl.\r\n\r\nParcells would have none of it, though. Interminable third-down blitzes, overreliance on the running game in the red zone, and thinking Random Cowboys Kicker (Shaun Suisham, anybody?) is always able to hit that 55-yarder. And, come on, Parcells openly disliked Mat McBriar in his first year -- this is evidence enough of the Tuna\'s idiocy.\r\n\r\nWade Phillips is not stupid. He coached one of the finest 3-4 defenses by any metric in San Diego last season and has a very similar level of talent with the Cowboys. Julius Jones has gotten better every year he\'s been in the league, even if Marion Barber III scored all the touchdowns last season. Terrell Owens and Terry Glenn are, perhaps, questionable health-wise but are still one of the finest receiving tandems in the NFL, and Patrick Crayton is a solid number three.\r\n\r\nAnything less than the NFC title game should be considered a disappointment for this team. I think 12-4 is the record (losses: at New York; at Chicago; New England; and at Washington, because our fate will be sealed); and I think we\'ll go to the Super Bowl.'),(182,'bshiff',2007,'2007-08-28 11:28:22','First off, Eric, I\'ve had 2 posts.  Well, three after this one, ya douchebag.\r\n\r\nWell, I am in love with the Cowboys, but the love started with my grandfather.  \r\n\r\nOk, I don\'t need to prove my love for the Cowboys.  I agree with Pat\'s assessment.  If the Cowboys don\'t make it to the NFC title game, I will personally drive up to Dallas and kill everyone.\r\n\r\nI\'m at work and bored, that\'s why I post so often.'),(183,'avasudev',2007,'2007-08-28 11:30:26','Favorite Team:  Raiders\r\nPrediction:  Super Bowl Champs\r\nReason:  They\'re not afraid to cap motherfuckers (see \'The Last Boy Scout\')'),(184,'rwilliams',2007,'2007-08-28 12:10:45','I pick Arsenal. :D'),(185,'dschexnayder',2007,'2007-08-28 12:28:14','Houston Texans baby. Year two of Koobs and it looks like the year this team will finally gel. Anything less than 8 wins will be disappointing as our offense should be top 10 in the league.

Lesser teams have made he playoffs (\'99 lions, \'98 cards who even won a game in those playoffs). Would I expect it? No, but after finally beating the colts for the first time in franchise history last season, anything seems possible. This team could win the NFC West.

Even adjusting for the weakness at safety, and the relative youth of the defense, we\'re an 8-8 or 7-9 team at worst.\r\n\r\nWith the best professional coach in the state by far, finally a legitimate quarterback, and a defense capable of holding their own, the Houston Texans will emerge as one of \'07\'s most pleasant surprises and capture the collective imaginations of football enthusiasts everywhere with a surprise playoff run.'),(187,'mjancaitis',2007,'2007-08-28 14:42:39','Pats.

I\'m not buying into Reggie Brown ever again.\r\nSeattle, well the Seahawks could and probably will finish above the Texans. But lists of three are a better rhetorical device, so I\'ll give you the old \"I have a bad feeling about this team.\" They have an aging quarterback who has really only had one superstar caliber year and a 30 year old RB who missed significant time last year (with a 3.6 YPC, yikes).

I really couldnt say why.  Maybe because wasn\'t born in Texas anyhow and my parents never had any team allegiances except for University of Arizona Basketball.  Right when we came to Texas was when the Cowboys started winning so obviously I had no strong ties.  And not understanding why everyone worshipped Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith was enough reason for me to cheer against them once I understood what the score was.\r\n\r\nEventually I decided that picking a team was essential to my football watching experience.  Peyton Manning just graduated and everyone was talking about him, so I chose the Colts.\r\n\r\nYou may say I took the easy route, but I went through all the motions.  Bought the merch, watched the playoff disasters, wore my jersey on gameday.  I didnt cut and run when Edge got hurt and then later took off (or got chased off)\r\n\r\nMy hatred for the Patriots began with their improbable win in Super Bowl XXVI.  Again, who can say why.  I just thought it was undeserved.\r\n\r\nNaturally that made every Colt\'s loss to the Patriots even worse.\r\n\r\nAfter the AFC Championship game in 2005, I made a conscious decision to stop caring about sports so much.  I still watched, but decided that I wasn\'t going to let if affect me in the same manner.  Naturally that would be the year that Texas wins the National Championship and the Colts go on a sickass winning streak.   Go figure.  Due to whatever reason, the Colts couldnt turn that regular season success into a Super Bowl and the Steelers instead brought one home for the thumb and the Bus.\r\n\r\nI actually had few complaints about that one.  Nice exit for a nice guy and through the tragedy with Dungy\'s son we learn some things are more important than football.  The whole reason I prolly stopped taking wins and losses so personally a year before.\r\n\r\nYear or so later, Edge is gone, Colts won a superbowl, black coaches, Old Mother Hubbards dog isnt so depressed due to recent insight into Michael Vicks pet ownership practices...blah blah blah\r\n\r\nAnd finally we get to the main point...\r\n\r\nColts make it to the playoffs at least provided that Manning and Marvin Harrison stay healthy and Bob Sanders comes back strong.'),(206,'jmckee',2007,'2007-08-29 02:12:26','Although I admit the Curtis analogy might have been going a little overboard.'),(207,'jmckee',2007,'2007-08-29 02:15:34','But for the record, its hard to get a lot of catches when you\'re the third receiver behind Tory Holt and Isaac Bruce.

Our secondary sucks hard, maybe even harder than last year. The fucking Houston Texans torched us (yeah yeah, it\'s only preseason, but it means something I think). The biggest problem is Terence Newman has an injury to his plantar fascitis, and he says he expects it to bother him all year. We needed to draft a cornerback in the first round this year, and we didn\'t, and I think the Cowboys will pay dearly. Roy Williams should have been traded a couple years ago; I don\'t get why he goes to the Pro Bowl year after year. He gets burned too frequently. Even Wade Phillips thinks our cornerback play sucks. Anthony Henry is too slow to be a good corner, Aaron Glenn is ancient, and we still didn\'t draft a corner in the first 2 rounds? Stupid.\r\nI think their offense is good enough to get the job done and some, but as long as the secondary keeps getting burned and the pass rush keeps falling short, I believe they come in second in the division to Philly. At 10-6, they get in as a Wildcard, and then I don\'t know what happens. It\'s been so long since a playoff win, too long, and I\'ve given up thinking that every year is their year.

Winston is no longer a rookie, Salaam and Black will hold down the left and the interior of the line is well regarded by analysts across the league. Kubiak\'s had a full offseason to bring his guys in so it\'s actually silly to think they won\'t improve. Even with last year\'s group, they still allowed Ron Freaking Dayne to average 4.1 yards per carry.\r\nWe can stop the Cowboy-Texans comparisons, but to discount Houston\'s offense is a big mistake.\r\nJohn: You said Curtis didn\'t get many catches because of the receivers ahead of him and because Bulger threw him the ball only 10% of the time. I told you he actually caught a lot of balls for a 3rd WR, but it was solely because of the high quantity of balls thrown by Bulger and that he was mediocre when he caught them. He also is a poor physical talent, other than his speed (making him an ideal 3 but not a good 2 when the #1 isn\'t very good). So what\'s the question? Where is this prediction that he\'s gonna be good coming from?

I love how everyone is claiming \"the Texans sucked the big one last year\". The Texans were a 6-10 team who could\'ve won 7 or 8 games easily. They were a DECENT 6-10 team. We BEAT the Super Bowl champs in a game in which they were trying to win. 2 years ago when they lost 14 and just as easily could\'ve lost 16, yes, then we sucked the big one. However, the first year under Kubiak was a quantum leap. Our o-line was even much approved, sacks of Carr (and his production based replacement Sage Rosenfels) decreased significantly, and really the only principle problem was Carr who never seemed comfortable. The guy was a bust period; have any of you actually seen him play for Carolina this pre-season? It\'s much of the same. Jake Delhomme is in no facet a great qb, but there\'s not much chance Carr is going to supplant him. If you want proof, it\'s in the pudding. Carr has a cannon arm, was the second best rushing quarterback in the league last year, but also has little confidence, and makes poor decisions. There\'s a huge debate amongst the Texans community that maybe (just maybe) a vast majority of those sacks in the first 4 years were in fact mostly David\'s fault.

It\'s a thing where, armed with a MySQL database prompt, I try to cite some interesting statistics and make fun of the winner(s) because they are not me.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a beautiful thing.\r\n\r\nSincere congratulations to Blair for posting an impressive 14-2 record in her rookie week outright win. I no longer have the data from the 2005 season (did I happen to send that to anybody?) and I\'m too lazy to go back earlier than that, but 14-2 is almost certainly a Week 1 record. Depending on how you look at it, however, it is not a record in general. Fourteen wins certainly ties the record for the most we\'ve had in a week, but 14-2 yields a mere .875 winning percentage, a meager figure next to Schex\'s .929 (13-1) from a few years back. Also, we\'ve had several other 14-2 finishes in the past: Schex, Luke, and myself have all done it.\r\n\r\nAs a group, our record this week was 201-119 (.628), which is ridiculous; last year in Week 1 we were 138-169 (.450). The newcomers -- Alok, Erica, and Blair -- went 34-14 (.708) whereas the money finishers from last year -- Jeff, Quinn, Schex, Eric, and myself -- went 45-35 (.563). Majority picks went 12-3 (there was no majority for Lions/Raiders) and the most-agreed-upon game was Titans/Jaguars with an 18-to-2 vote in favor of our Lord and Savior, Vincent Paul Young, Jr. Let it also be noted that Blair\'s two losses were majority picks and that she was only once in the minority with her Carolina pick. In Week 1, home teams went 11-5, favorites went 11-5, home favorites went 9-3, and home underdogs went 2-2.\r\n\r\nSo what\'s the explanation for our aggregate awesomeness? Are Blair and Erica -- girls! rookies! -- far more insightful than any of us -- boys! veterans! -- could ever hope to be?\r\n\r\nLet\'s examine, shall we?\r\n\r\nWeek 1 is a funny week. We\'ve followed the offseason and we know who\'s gotten better and which coach is implementing which scheme but, let\'s be honest, we don\'t really know anything about the teams yet, and neither do the casinos. Lines in Week 1 are typically far more conservative than they\'ll be for the rest of the year. To give you an idea of just how conservative, last year, the average favorite in Weeks 1 through 17, respectively, were favored by: 3.81, 6.63, 5.07, 5.36, 6.29, 6.58, 5.04, 5.14, 5.93, 6.44, 4.38, 5.13, 4.94, 3.88, 5.88, 4.06, and 6.25. This year in Week 1: 3.94.\r\n\r\nSo spreads are smaller. So what?\r\n\r\nWell, shocking as this may be, we tend to pick favorites.\r\n\r\nLast year, in Week 1, 67.1% of our picks were for the favored team. The next-closest rate of favorite-picking that year was in Week 6 (65.3%) followed by Week 7 (64.2%) and brought up in the rear by the always goofy Week 17 (52.3%). Overall last year, we picked favorites 61.1 percent of the time. What was our favorite-rate for this year\'s Week 1, you may ask? 65.9%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, rookies, especially in Week 1, pick favorites more often than anyone else. This year, Alok, Erica, and Blair picked 35 out of 48 favorites (72.9%); last year, Koci, Peter, Quinn, and Zak picked 45 out of 64 favorites (70.3%). Most rookies to this contest are not familiar with picking games against the spread -- it\'s just not something they\'re used to thinking about. A good number of the rookies to this contest haven\'t even been all that interested in the NFL. It seems like a natural thing for somebody in unfamiliar territory to default to picking \"the team which is supposed to win.\"\r\n\r\nNow, admittedly, I was surprised to see that there wasn\'t a huge spike last year in aggregate favorite-rate for Week 1. I thought that Week 1 would be the week where everybody -- not just rookies -- would sort of default to pick whoever was supposed to win. Instead, though, it seems more likely that we have already made our decisions about the teams and are just more inclined to pick the favorite in Week 1 because they don\'t have as large of a spread to cover, relative to the rest of the season.\r\n\r\nBut do favorites perform better in Week 1 since they have relatively small spreads to cover? It\'s doubtful. This year, yeah, they went 11-5. Last year, though? 5-11.\r\n\r\nSo Week 1 favorites are smaller, on average, than favorites over the rest of the season, enticing us to pick them even more often than we already do. Rookies, perhaps due to being unfamiliar with the frame of mind one needs for being successful in this contest, are still more prone to pick favorites in Week 1. This year, those favorites went 11-5.\r\n\r\nThat, my friends, is a recipe for rookie sensations and overall success.'),(325,'jmckee',2007,'2007-09-11 23:48:12','I find it interesting that the majority of your analysis is gleaned from the information I requested on a splits page. coincidence?'),(326,'bshiff',2007,'2007-09-12 07:12:46','I just played an awesome drinking game to Pat\'s post.

We agree on this, right?\r\n\r\nYour examples of other teams cheating are spotty, at best.\r\n\r\nYou reference Mike Shanhan doing something which probably goes against the spirit of the game but is not actually against the rules. Is it okay with you if his linebackers listen to the quarterback\'s cadence and try to figure it out so they can gain an edge? Is it okay for the quarterback to be deceptive with his cadence in the first place?\r\n\r\nYour Miami example (if it\'s even true) would be a little better except that it happened against [b]the Patriots[/b]. Belichick has received documented complaints about using these sort of tactics over the years and so maybe the Dolphins thought turnabout was actually, in this case, fair play. Moreover, again, that was never even shown to be against the rules.\r\n\r\nSchex has already made note that there was no salary cap to cheat when the 49ers were winning championships.\r\n\r\nNow, as for the \"overblown\"-ness of it all, I don\'t think anyone ever said that this has been overblown.

About once a day, this thing takes an awesome look into the numbers of football -- a field that hasn\'t yet been reduced to an exact science the way baseball has -- and gives you some really interesting things to think about. Fire Joe Morgan, while it may seem like an odd choice, can seriously teach you a load of stuff about baseball, especially (specifically) if you\'re interested in sabermetrics. Also, it\'s hilarious.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I really try to avoid ESPN when they\'re not showing sports nowadays, but if I happen to catch SportsCenter or whatever, I think John Clayton, Peter Gammons, and Chris Mortensen are all consistently awesome, and Tim Kurkjian is usually pretty cool. Non-actual-sports shows that I don\'t mind watching on ESPN are pretty much limited to \"Pardon the Interruption.\"\r\n\r\nBut really, sports are dumb.

It\'ll be short and sweet.\r\n\r\nCollectively, we went 169-135 (.556) which is pretty darn good but, as expected, worse than last week\'s 201-119 (.628).\r\n\r\nKoci and Keyon tied for 12 wins this week so the $5 jackpot carries over to next week.\r\n\r\nThere were two games tied for the greatest majority -- Bengals/Browns and Cowboys/Dolphins were both 18-1 splits (for the Bengals and Cowboys, respectively). The league lost the first and won the second.\r\n\r\nTo that end, the majority went 10-6 (.625) this week bringing them to a cool 22-9 (.710). Mob rule seems to be effective early on.\r\n\r\nThe average favorite in Week 2 was favored by 6.25 points, up from 3.94 last week. I hypothesize that this huge jump (also seen last year) has to do not only with Week 1\'s conservatism but also with knee-jerk reactions to Week 1 performances. Expect a huge drop-off in the average size of favorites for Week 3.\r\n\r\nMoney winners from 2006 were 47-33 (.586) in Week 2; rookies were 17-15 (.531). Note that unpicked games (Alok) are not included in any of these calculations.\r\n\r\nFinally, a quick line of splits for you.

This probably has something to do with the majority decision successfully coming through a mere 8 out of 14 times (.571) -- Chargers/Packers and Rams/Buccaneers were both split evenly. On the year, though, the mob seems to know what they\'re doing -- the popular pick is 30-15 (.667).\r\n\r\nIn Week 3, last year\'s money winners were 44-36 (.550); this year\'s rookies were 22-26 (.458). This week, home teams were 9-7, favorites were 8-8, home favorites were 7-6, and home underdogs were 2-1.\r\n\r\nFavorites in Week 3 were favorites by an average of 5.06 points which is a pretty significant drop from last week\'s 6.25. Note that the average favorite lines during the first three weeks of this season (3.94, 6.25, 5.06) are strikingly similar to the analogous numbers from last season (3.81, 6.63, 5.07). Just to throw a (completely unresearched) hypothesis out there to explain this behavior, I\'d guess that in Week 1, nobody knows anything and the lines are kept low, in Week 2, everybody has knee-jerk reactions to the Week 1 winners and holds them to high standards, and in Week 3, thanks to the overrating of favorites, the lines come back down towards some equilibrium. Don\'t expect them to stay around 5 points, though -- last year they went above 6 four more times. (Oh, it could also just be luck. Certainly that 16.5-point spread for the Bills/Patriots game influenced the average a little -- by 0.76 points, in fact!)\r\n\r\nThere\'s really not too much interesting about this year yet. Established decent-pickers are doing decently and rookies are coming back down to Earth (or forgetting to pick). Maybe something interesting lies in how frequently we pick a team?\r\n\r\nThe Cowboys have been picked 56 times, the most often by far. Tied for second with 44 picks are the Bengals and the Steelers. (There are a number of teams bunched around 40 picks total.) The least-picked teams are the Bears and the Giants, tied with 14 total picks. Then there are the Dolphins (16) and the Buccaneers (18).\r\n\r\nIf you take a look at which teams have been covering spreads and which teams haven\'t, you\'ll notice that our most frequently picked teams are usually doing well -- the Cowboys have covered all three of their spreads, as have the Steelers, although the Bengals have covered only one -- and our least frequently picked teams are usually doing poorly -- the Bears and Dolphins have yet to cover a spread, the Giants have covered one, and the Buccaneers have covered two.\r\n\r\nIt\'s hard to tell whether our popular opinion should be doing well or not: last year, the mob went 122-123 (.498). Also, it should be noted that there could be some effect seen when people stop picking at the end of the season. Whether this helps or hurts (or does nothing) to the figure is completely unknown to me.\r\n\r\nWhile I have the SQL queries ready to go, the teams that were most-picked last year were the Bears (212 picks; 10 covers), the Chargers (207 picks; 9 covers), and the Cowboys (193 picks; 8 covers). The teams that were least-picked were the Raiders (81 picks; 6 covers), the Dolphins (97 picks; 6 covers), the Browns (104 picks; 7 covers), and the Buccaneers (106 picks; 7 covers). Also of note: the Bills were picked infrequently (112 picks) but covered the spread often (10 covers); similarly, the Broncos were picked frequently (159 picks) but rarely covered the spread (5 covers).\r\n\r\nThis wrap-up was pretty boring.

He\'d achieve around 85% accuracy against-the-spread. (A typical winning accuracy for this contest has been 54%.)\r\n\r\nOf course, such an oracle does not exist, so what about us? It\'s an interesting question to estimate how each of us would do in a straight-up picks contest. I really wasn\'t sure about the number, but I guessed that 65% accuracy would be a pretty alright year. I asked a number of you and everybody gave answers at or around that figure, so I feel pretty good with it. Further, so far this year, the [url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/pickem;_ylt=ApuJnkJkZU6PiVLicjr_zGBDubYF]Yahoo! Experts[/url] are 155-85 (.646) which makes me a bit more comfortable with my 65% figure, although maybe it\'s closer to the high-end than I thought it was.\r\n\r\nScaling the numbers, assuming that 65% of your straight-up winners come through, I found that you would have achieved 55% accuracy against the spread. Easily enough to have a great shot at first place and a sure money-winner. Say you think you\'re better than 65%, though; maybe you think you pick 70% of the game-winners. If that were the case, you\'d be looking at a nearly 60% accuracy against the spread.\r\n\r\nMaybe we\'re all approaching this the wrong way.'),(518,'mjancaitis',2007,'2007-09-28 05:45:06','Maybe that\'s the average, but what\'s the most-likely win value?'),(519,'jpnance',2007,'2007-09-28 06:06:33','As anybody who pays any attention probably suspects, games are settled by 3 points more often than any other amount (141 out of the 816 games we have on record) followed not-so-closely by 7 points (85 out of 816).

Playing without their two most feared run defenders -- nose tackle Casey Hampton and strong safety Troy Polamalu -- the Steelers held Seattle running backs to 12 carries for 27 yards. Folks, this is not only a good team. It\'s a deep team[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Nothing too bad, here. If the Steelers can run the ball effectively, yeah, they\'re pretty good. Take away the run, though, and Big Ben will lose them the game. Sorry, that was too analytic. I was trying to do my best impersonation of somebody who is not Peter King.\r\n\r\n[b]5. Green Bay (4-1). The Packers could have had a four-game lead over the Bears in the NFC North. Now you know why coach Mike McCarthy and offensive coordinator Joe Philbin have been preaching about turnovers since the first Green Bay minicamp. Talk about throwing a game away.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: I\'ve often wondered why more coaches don\'t stress the importance of not turning the ball over. Say what you want about \"the old way of doing things,\" but the new wisdom is that turning the ball over is bad. It\'s nice to see that the Packers are ushering in this new era of progressive knowledge.\r\n\r\n[b]6. San Diego (2-3). The bidding opens for free-agent-to-be Michael Turner at, what ... $7 million a year?[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Why bother? The Peter King Running Back Theory states that running back is the easiest position to fill on a football team. Surely teams could find cheaper options than Michael Turner. Troy Hambrick is (was) a running back and would not ask for $7mil to play! Why not use the money towards positions that are much harder to replace like kicker, or longsnapper, or perennial special teams guy.\r\n\r\nOn a serious note, I think Michael Turner is probably pretty decent (6.2 yards per carry, career!), but the bulk of his yards come in clean-up duty when LaDainian Tomlinson has been murdering the defense. Just seems a little quick to proclaim him The Next Big-Ticket Running Back (Who Is Easily Replaced, According to Theory Proven by Peter King). I mean, $7mil is about what LDT makes.\r\n\r\nAlso, 74 of Turner\'s 147 yards came on one play. His previous yard totals this year: 41 (10 carries), 3 (1 carry), 12 (4 carries), -2 (2 carries). Give that man his top-tier running back money!\r\n\r\n[b]7. Jacksonville (3-1). Jags had a 10:55 drive in Kansas City, a classic Jack Del Rio 18-play, mashing field-goal drive. Ten runs, eight passes. Perfect for the Jags, who want to play offense the way the 1980s Giants did. (There\'s even a carbon copy of Joe Morris: Maurice Jones-Drew. Only quicker.)[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Whatever. I\'m just amused that the Jags needed 18 plays only to stall out and have to kick a field goal. Side note: \"Joe\" and \"Morris\" are sort of like \"Jones\" and \"Maurice.\" I do not believe this is merely a coincidence.\r\n\r\n[b]8. Tennessee (3-1). The Titans are 9-2 in their last 11. They turned it over five times against Atlanta and still won.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: No argument here. The Falcons are lousy. Although maybe if the Titans coaches had preached about turnovers, the game would never even have been in question. Will these coaches never learn?\r\n\r\n[b]9. Washington (3-1). Welcome to premier status, Mr. Campbell. You look really, really good.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Premier status. For a guy who now has a better-than-50% pass completion percentage in 6 of his 11 starts. Who just set a high mark in passing yards for his career at 248. Against the Lions, who field one of the worst pass defenses in the league.\r\n\r\nI think Campbell will be a pretty okay starter, but premier status? Get Derek Anderson and Jay Cutler on the phone and tell them they\'ve achieved high chancellor of the universe status.\r\n\r\n[b]10. Tampa Bay (3-2). At one point, I looked up at the TV and noted Jeff Garcia, in the hostile RCA Dome, was 19 of 23. What a great signing by Bruce Allen and Jon Gruden.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: I started a response talking about how Garcia had only passed for 143 yards in that game (and it was 18 of 23, not 19), but I changed my mind about posting it. Instead, I\'d like to mock the Peter King Running Back Theory some more.\r\n\r\nThe Bucs lost Carnell Williams for the season last week. Lucky for them, running backs are easy to replace! Earnest Graham will fill the role of easy-to-replace running back very nicely!\r\n\r\nGraham carried the ball 6 times for 11 yards. That included busting what I\'m sure was a totally sweet 9-yarder. Michael Pittman had 5 carries for -1 yards before getting injured. And a long of four.\r\n\r\n[b]11. New York Giants (3-2). I know, I know. You\'re thinking: How can you have the Giants, who beat the Redskins on Washington\'s home turf, two slots behind the Redskins? Washington\'s been better over five weeks.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: I\'m really not here to complain about the stupid ordering but, for the record, the Giants have only lost to teams that we think are pretty good (Cowboys and Packers: combined 8-1). And, I mean, technically, the Redskins have only played four weeks. So I\'m not exactly sure what \"they\'ve been better over five weeks\" means. I digress.\r\n\r\n[b]12. Chicago (2-3). The only way the Bears could save their season was to be opportunistic on defense and get three or four plays out of Brian Griese. Both things happened.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: I love how \"opportunistic defense\" really just means \"get fluky turnovers.\" This, by the way, has been the gameplan of the Chicago Bears since they were founded in Decatur, Illinois in 1919 (thanks, Wikipedia!). Jim McMahon won a Super Bowl. I rest my case.\r\n\r\n[b]13. Carolina (3-2). Can you believe Julius Peppers is sackless in five games? That\'s like A-Rod being homerless in the playoffs. The best Panther on defense Sunday at the Superdome: Rookie middle linebacker Jon Beason, with 13 tackles and a ton of impact.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Now we\'re talking! An A-Rod reference! Except that it\'s not like A-Rod being homerless in the playoffs because he is a choking choker who chokes.\r\n\r\nBesides that opportunistic sarcasm, yeah, it is kind of surprising that Julius hasn\'t found the quarterback yet. He averages over 10 sacks a year. I doubt he\'s getting double-teamed any more now than in past years so I can only call it luck. And I\'m comfortable doing that.\r\n\r\n[b]14. Baltimore (3-2). The Ravens haven\'t shown me, or anyone else in the United States, much. They almost lost to Trent Dilfer on Sunday. If they don\'t get better on offense, they\'ll need a Fine 22 to be on this list before long.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: Nothing wrong with King here. He\'s right. Their defense is still good yards-wise, but 19.4 points allowed per game is way worse than it was last season. It doesn\'t help that McNair and McGahee can\'t keep the offense on the field, though.\r\n\r\n[b]15. Arizona (3-2). Kurt Warner has a 102.3 passer rating. If he keeps that up over the next six weeks -- which is a gigantic \"if\'\' -- the Cardinals will be serious playoff contenders on Thanksgiving.[/b]\r\n\r\nPN: The Cardinals just allowed 31 points to a team with neither its starting quarterback nor its starting running back nor its starting left tackle. I think a little more than a sweet passer rating from Kurt Warner will be needed for the Cardinals to make a playoff run. Jon Kitna has a 93.2 passer rating and that includes getting absolutely destroyed by the Redskins defense.\r\n\r\n'),(600,'ksomandar',2007,'2007-10-09 03:48:51','Nice.'),(601,'ksomandar',2007,'2007-10-09 03:51:28','The GB game was more about the awful playcalling than the turnovers I though.

Plug in a back to a good system and line and he will be good, plug in a back to a bad line and he will suck. He\'s not saying there is always a back that can succeed with your crappy line, he\'s saying there is always a back who can play roughly equivalent to whatever your current guy is doing.\r\nThat\'s something I largely agree with. Teams have had consistent success running the ball with different backs (Denver, Pittsburgh) and sustained failure as well (Arizona, Detroit). \r\nTampa wasn\'t exactly great at running the ball with Cadillac either and he has had many games (in his first year especially) that looked a lot like Graham\'s yesterday, just with more carries.
