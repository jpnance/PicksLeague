			<h4>Picks Leaguers,</h4>
			<p class="mt-4">Twenty years ago, David Schexnayder and I were in high school and decided it'd be fun to actually keep track of our NFL picks for the rest of the season. We recruited a bunch of our friends (Jeff Arbor nee Sneden, Keyon Somandar, and Luke Zimmermann were all among them) and a few pieces of notebook paper became what I considered to be the first running of the Picks League.</p>
			<p>A couple of years later, a bunch of us were going off to college but I still wanted to play, so I used what web development chops I had to rig up a website where people could enter their own picks. This was the first time I'd ever used a database (and, if you lifted up the hood, it was obvious) and so, really, it was also the first user-facing web app that I made in my life.</p>
			<p>A few years after that, Jeff and I worked a lot on overhauling both the database schema and the look of the site. Visually and interactively, it hasn't changed much since 2006. There are plenty of things I would do differently now but what we came up with has held up well.</p>
			<p>More than just a game for me, the Picks League is something I've shown off in job interviews as a self-motivated project that makes different systems talk to each other. I think it played a big role in getting me hired at ESPN, which is where I generally consider my software development career to have started. Beyond my professional life, it's also been the catalyst for <a href="https://subcontest.coinflipper.org/">however</a>-<a href="https://classics.coinflipper.org/">many</a> <a href="https://pickahit.coinflipper.org/">other</a> pools I've made over the years. You may even be able to draw a line from the Picks League to <a href="https://deleveledgame.com/">Deleveled</a>, my video game that released last year. The project has meant a ton to me.</p>
			<p>It's both with sadness and satisfaction that I write y'all to say that the Picks League will not launch this year and is now retired. The success of the Picks League was its curse: it lasted long enough that it really hammered home every year how impossible it is to pick every NFL game against a point-spread (although Brett Ludwiczak sure seems to have figured it out, so what do I know). Some years ago, I found out about the SuperContest in Las Vegas and launched a similar game (the <a href="https://subcontest.coinflipper.org/">SubContest</a>, of course) that, to me and, I know, to many of y'all, is seen as more fun. At this point, nearly everyone in the Picks League is in the SubContest (join us, Brett, Erica, and Zak!) and so I think the time is right to say goodbye.</p>
			<p>Before we say goodbye, though, let's say thank you. Thank you so much to David Schexnayder for telling me one day that I should write down our picks so we could see how we did on Monday. Thank you so much to Jeff Arbor for teaching me anything at all about database normalization and helping me totally re-implement the site for the Web 2.0 era (I have no clue which Web era we're in now, though). Thank you so much to Ken Naishtat for being the sysadmin of this site for well over half its life (shout-out if you remember <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061106121828/http://picks.kenners.net/">http://picks.kenners.net/</a>) and the only person specifically referenced in the rules (there used to be a small carve-out for hosting costs).</p>
			<p>Finally, thank you so, so, so much to all of you for playing. These games all mean a lot to me and this one has a particularly special place in my heart. I love that y'all have stuck around for so long and I truly appreciate every one of you for clicking a bunch of purple boxes every week. I hope y'all had fun and that you'll keep clicking those boxes in other games of mine.</p>

			<p class="mt-4">P.S.&mdash;I thought I'd attach some Picks League ephemera for the motivated reader.</p>
			<p>If you've ever wondered why we had a $27 entry fee, it's because we first started playing for money in college and thought $20 was the sweet spot but, after hosting costs, the pool wouldn't be that big. We added $7 to make the numbers work out a bit better and considered just rounding up to $30 but we thought people would be psychologically turned off by a round number higher than $20, so we just left it at $27. I never changed it because I always enjoyed how goofy the number was (but I also didn't want to force myself to recalibrate all the prizes).</p>
			<p>While my other contests are open-entry, I always (at least after the first few years) filled the Picks League to exactly twenty entrants. The origin of this was that our design didn't elegantly handle more than 20 columns on the table back in whatever screen resolution era it was fifteen years ago. After a while, it became another quirk I just kinda liked, this idea that we may not have room for someone in the pool (though this was rarely the case and I was more often begging some of y'all to join so we could get to twenty).</p>
			<p>Way back, it was actually a rule that if you got the most picks correct in a week (even if it wasn't an outright win), you could request a logo to be added to the pool. That's why there are so many strange logos in there, in addition to the 32 NFL logos. Although I absolutely love the visual flavor and personality this gives the site, it became unsustainable for me to commit to doing it every single week, so I eventually stopped. It also opened my eyes to how annoying some of those logos can be to work with, at least in our constrained vertical space (looking at you, <a href="https://coinflipper.org/logos/broncos.png">Broncos</a> and <a href="https://coinflipper.org/logos/eagles.png">Eagles</a>). I can say with full honesty that the <a href="https://coinflipper.org/logos/longhorns.png">Longhorns</a> logo is my favorite; I hate how well the <a href="https://coinflipper.org/logos/patriots.png">Patriots</a> logo came out; Luke, Zak, and Brett probably still think the <a href="https://coinflipper.org/logos/buckeyes.png">Ohio State</a> logo is too pink but I insist that it looks great.</p>
			<p>Speaking of that Longhorn logo, it's been a tradition for me for a long time now to go into the database and make it everyone's logo on the Friday before Texas plays Oklahoma. You've always been free to change it right back if you wanted to and it was the only time I ever manually changed anyone's settings.</p>
			<p>Final thing on logos: nobody ever requested A&amp;M or OU, nor would they have been fulfilled. There are limits.</p>
